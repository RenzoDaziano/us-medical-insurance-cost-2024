# Insurance Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing an insurance dataset to identify key insights about the factors influencing medical insurance charges. The analysis focuses on the average age of patients, regional distributions, cost differences between smokers and non-smokers, and the impact of having children on the average age of patients.

## Data Source

The source of the data is [Kaggle Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).

## Course Information

This project is part of the courses "Data Engineering" and "Business Intelligence Analyst" at Codecademy.

## Analysis Results

### Average Age of Patients

The average age of patients in the dataset is **39.21** years.

### Regional Distribution

The majority of the patients are from the **southeast** region.

### Cost Analysis

- **Average Cost for Non-Smokers**: $8,434.27
- **Average Cost for Smokers**: $32,050.23
- **Cost Difference between Smokers and Non-Smokers**: $23,615.96

### Average Age with Children

The average age of patients with at least one child is **39.78** years.

## Predicted Influential Features

Based on the analysis, the following features are predicted to be the most influential for an individual's medical insurance charges:

1. Smoking Status
2. Age
3. BMI
4. Number of Children
5. Region

## Potential Biases in the Data

Several potential biases were identified that could impact the results and their generalizability:

1. Sample Bias
2. Measurement Bias
3. Socioeconomic Factors
4. Access to Healthcare

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing medical insurance charges. By understanding these key factors, policymakers and insurers can better design targeted interventions and policies to manage healthcare costs and improve public health outcomes.
